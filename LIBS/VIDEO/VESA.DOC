 VESA2.0 INTERFACE


 dafear!!!!!! :)

 here is a quick list of all functions available.


 VESAdetect()

    this _MUST_ be called at the start of your program. it detects if VESA2
    is present and if so, initalises some stuff. you should take note of
    the error returned from this function. see the example.c file for the
    error codes.


 VESAopen_surface()

    this will search for the mode you specify and setup a surface structure.
    then it will set the desired mode ready for use.

 VESAfind_surface()

    this will search for the mode you specify but _NOT_ set it. instead it
    will simply return TRUE or FALSE depending on if the mode was found
    or not.

 VESAset_mode()

    this will set a mode number directly, no searching. it will also set
    bios modes.

 VESAclosedown()

    this will close down this interface. you should call it at the end of
    your program

 VESAset_bank()

    sets the bank number :)

 VESAset_display_start()

    sets the start address of the display


 SURFACE STRUCTURE:

    this is very simple. a surface structure is just a load of info about
    the mode you have set. it includes this stuff:

    xsize, ysize, bpp

        thats obvious :)

    vram

        the amount of video ram available in bytes

    numpages

        the amount of video pages you have in this mode

    pagesize

        the size in bytes of a page, used for switching pages :)

    lfb

        pointer to the linear frame buffer
