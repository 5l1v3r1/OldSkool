OldSkool
========

Dumping ground for some oldskool demoscene related stuff and things I did a long long time ago now dating from 1995 onwards I imagine. 
Most of this is just things of mine I found lying around and so I thought I'd place them here in case they ever become interesting to someone in the future.

You will notice my name or alias (frenzy) splattered around the code.

Most of it is for MSDOS and is probably written in C using Watcom C and Assembly language where I used A86 and Tasm. The source code is in keeping with a demoscene/hacking mentality.. Not clean, not ideal just works. A fine approach to self teaching you the skillz of the hardcore hacker. I hope you understand the term hacker is used in the correct context :)

You'll find cracktros, bbs adverts, 3D engines with 3D Studio keyframing support (software), fake hicolour modes, vesa 2 stuff, protected mode stuff, 2D effects, and a load of misc routines that may or may not work. Fast maths functions like 1/sqrt using a 1k lookup table and plenty other gems. These tricks and so on are still handy today on different types of hardware! You would be surprised! Concepts like self modifying code, anti-debugging and so on litter the code so enjoy the trip down memory lane :-)

Where I can I include all exe's and resources so they can be run in DOSBOX.

Alot of them do run in DOSBOX just make sure you increase your clock cycle count to alter their run speed.. And make sure you put DOS4GW.EXE in the same directory. Not everything used that. Some used PMODE/W by TRAN!! Now that is a name from the past!

cltr-f12/ctrl-f11 to increase/decrease.

Some of this stuff was targetted to 386 machines, some 486 and of course pentium.

Quick rundown:
1kIntro - intro under 1k featuring 2d bump map, fractal and tunnel effect. source in .ASM file, executable in .COM and readme in the .NFO

BBS - old BBS advert intros.. source in ASM and executables are .COM

Exes - old effects using an old 3D engine

Fake Hicolour - old plasma effect using XMODE to create a fake hicolour mode. source is in ASM but also in Pascal (.PAS) and executable

Intros - some more old cractro style intros. lots of ASM source and exes to run.

L3D - 3d engine written in C with 3DS (3d studio) reader, keyframer, etc. Run the 'runme.bat' file with the name of the .3DS file to render and animate... only has a sub-pixel flat filler for debugging.. hence the multi-coloured triangles..

LIBS - some general interesting code

Old Tutorials - old html tutors I wrote about certain things relating to 3D graphics and algorithms

Raytrace Tunnel - a realtime raytraced tunnel and infinite plane. used a grid and interpolation between grip points. Handy for lots of interesting things, not just raytracing.. interpolating grid points is a good speedup for lots of things :)

UART - very early ASM code I wrote to talk to UART (serial port) back in the days when transferring files between computers was done via floppy disk and serial/parallel cables using tools like laplink!

X-Copy - based on the popular amiga X-Copy program (google it!) its a graphical disk copyier that I did a long long time ago for my A-Level computer science project. Its here because I actually found it on an old backup CD and its exactly 20 years old as of writing this document!!! Wow.. time flys when your coding assembler :)
