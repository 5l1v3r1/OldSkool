OldSkool
========

Dumping ground for some oldskool demoscene related stuff and things I did a long long time ago now :-)

Most of this is just things of mine I found lying around and so I thought I'd place them here in case they ever become interesting to someone in the future.


Some of this was written when I was at UNI, some for a defunct demoscene group I made called Liquid. Most under my alias as frenzy :-)

Most of it is for MSDOS and is probably written in C using Watcom C and Assembly language where I used A86 and Tasm.

Where I can I include all exe's and resources so they can be run in DOSSHELL.
