OldSkool
========

Dumping ground for some oldskool demoscene related stuff and things I did a long long time ago now dating from 1995 onwards I imagine.

Most of this is just things of mine I found lying around and so I thought I'd place them here in case they ever become interesting to someone in the future.

You will notice my name or alias (frenzy) splattered around the code.

Most of it is for MSDOS and is probably written in C using Watcom C and Assembly language where I used A86 and Tasm. The source code is in keeping with a demoscene/hacking mentality.. Not clean, not ideal just works. A fine approach to self teaching you the skillz of the hardcore hacker. 

You'll find cracktros, bbs adverts, 3D engines with 3D Studio keyframing support (software), fake hicolour modes, vesa 2 stuff, protected mode stuff, 2D effects, and a load of misc routines that may or may not work. Concepts like self modifying code, anti-debugging and so on litter the code so enjoy the trip down memory lane :-)

Where I can I include all exe's and resources so they can be run in DOSSHELL.

Alot of them do run in DOSSHELL just make sure you increase your clock cycle count to alter their run speed..

cltr-f12/ctrl-f-11 to increase/decrease.

Some of this stuff was targetted to 386 machines, some 486 and of course pentium.

Cheers,
paul .. aka frenzy
